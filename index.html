                <!-- since the first time. I saw you in college.
                I was siting in CIVIL garden and you were coming toward me.
                when I saw you, I was like "Wow! she is so beautiful".
                I wanted to talk to you but but how.... , then i saw you talking to a friend of mine.
                and that's how I started talking to you.
                I was so happy that day.
                you were not like my expectation but Better.
                you were so cute and innocent. I was like "I want to be with her forever".
                then after few days I saw you crying , because of your keys were lost.
                don't know why it hurts me when i saw you crying then i ran to find your keys.
                got it somehow and you stopped crying and smile. I got relief that I made you smile.
                was the time i realized that I love you.
                And I want to keep seeing you till my last breath. -->
                <b>The First Time </b> I saw you was back in college.<br/>
I was sitting in the Civil Garden, and you were walking toward me.<br/>
The moment I saw you, I thought to myself, "Wow, she's so beautiful."<br/>
I wanted to talk to you so badly but I didnâ€™t know how...<br/>
And then, by pure luck, I saw you talking to a friend of mine.<br/>
Thatâ€™s how I finally got the chance to speak with you.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being so happy that day.<br/>
You werenâ€™t what I expected <br/>
You were so much more.<br/>
So cute, so innocent... I couldnâ€™t help but think, "I want to be with her forever."<br/>
<br/>
A few days later, I saw you crying because you'd lost your keys.<br/>
I donâ€™t know why, but seeing you like that hurt me.<br/>
I just couldnâ€™t stand seeing you upset.<br/>
So I ran off to search for your keys, and somehow ,I found them.<br/>
<br/>
When you smiled again... I felt such relief.<br/>
It meant everything to me that I was the reason behind your smile.<br/>
That moment... that was when I realized:<br/>
I love you.<br/>
<br/>
And I want to keep seeing you<br/>
To be with you<br/>
For the rest of my life.<br/>

                Happy Birthday, my forever love ðŸ’–
If I had all the words in the world, they still wouldnâ€™t be enough to tell you how much you mean to me.
You are the reason my heart beats softer, my days feel warmer, and my world feels like home.
<br/>
<br/>

On this day, the universe aligned âœ¨ to bring you into the world and eventually, into my life.
Since then, nothing has been the same.
Youâ€™ve shown me what real love feels like not just passion and fire, but peaceâ€¦ the kind that stays.
<br/>
<br/>

I love the way your laugh fills a room, the way your eyes light up,
and the way just being near you makes everything feel right.
You are not just the woman I love you are my wife, my girl friend, my heartâ€™s favorite place to be.
<br/>
<br/>

So today, I celebrate you
the beautiful soul that you are,
and the gift it is to love you, every single day.
<br/>
<br/>

With all of me,<br/>
Forever yours ðŸ’Œ
