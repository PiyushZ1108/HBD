                <!-- since the first time. I saw you in college.
                I was siting in CIVIL garden and you were coming toward me.
                when I saw you, I was like "Wow! she is so beautiful".
                I wanted to talk to you but but how.... , then i saw you talking to a friend of mine.
                and that's how I started talking to you.
                I was so happy that day.
                you were not like my expectation but Better.
                you were so cute and innocent. I was like "I want to be with her forever".
                then after few days I saw you crying , because of your keys were lost.
                don't know why it hurts me when i saw you crying then i ran to find your keys.
                got it somehow and you stopped crying and smile. I got relief that I made you smile.
                was the time i realized that I love you.
                And I want to keep seeing you till my last breath. -->
                <b>The First Time </b> I saw you was back in college.<br/>
I was sitting in the Civil Garden, and you were walking toward me.<br/>
The moment I saw you, I thought to myself, "Wow, she's so beautiful."<br/>
I wanted to talk to you so badly but I didn’t know how...<br/>
And then, by pure luck, I saw you talking to a friend of mine.<br/>
That’s how I finally got the chance to speak with you.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being so happy that day.<br/>
You weren’t what I expected <br/>
You were so much more.<br/>
So cute, so innocent... I couldn’t help but think, "I want to be with her forever."<br/>
<br/>
A few days later, I saw you crying because you'd lost your keys.<br/>
I don’t know why, but seeing you like that hurt me.<br/>
I just couldn’t stand seeing you upset.<br/>
So I ran off to search for your keys, and somehow ,I found them.<br/>
<br/>
When you smiled again... I felt such relief.<br/>
It meant everything to me that I was the reason behind your smile.<br/>
That moment... that was when I realized:<br/>
I love you.<br/>
<br/>
And I want to keep seeing you<br/>
To be with you<br/>
For the rest of my life.<br/>

And that's good, too. So, they can say that you're high-maintenance, but it's OK because I like maintaining you."
